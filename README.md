# Pyamit
A Python practise repository!

## Structure
Each script/topic goes inside it's own folder with a README.md
Line 1 of the README should be a H1 title of the script/topic
Line 3 of the README should be a H2 short description

Folders must **not** have spaces in the name otherwise the folder links **will not work**

**ALWAYS RUN `update.py` BEFORE PUSHING COMMITS**

e.g.
```
# Project title

## Short description of this project
```
